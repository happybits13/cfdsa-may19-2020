Mounting file to volume
--------------------------------------
1) Create PersistentVolumeClaim (pvc).
2) Create Volume in Pod(mysql-vol), tag to pvc. 
3) [Optional] Clense newly created Volume (New volume pre-configuration loads in some data you might not want)
4) Create VolumeMount in container. Map VolumeMount with volume and desired file to mounted. In this eg, /var/lib/mysql to mysql-vol
